1. Code editor: VS Code
2. Browser - Google chrome - Version 119.0.6045.159
3. OS: MacOS Sonoma version 14.1
4. Testing:
Testing a web application involves various aspects to ensure it works well for the
majority of users. Here's how I'd approach testing the code for a web page
managing books:
Unit Testing: Writing unit tests for individual functions and classes using tools like
Jest or Mocha with Chai. For instance, testing book addition, retrieval, and
ensuring proper behavior of functions.
Integration Testing: Verifying the interaction between different modules or
components of the application. This ensures that the various parts work together
seamlessly. For example, testing the interaction between the book manager and
the book display module.
Cross-Browser Testing: Checking the web page's functionality and appearance
across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure
compatibility. Tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs can help simulate different
environments.

5. TypeScript features used:
In the provided TypeScript assignment for a book management system, several advanced TypeScript features are used:

Modules: Utilizing the export and import keywords to organize code into separate files/modules, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Interfaces: Defining the Book interface to establish a contract for book objects, ensuring consistency and structure throughout the application.

Classes: Employing the class syntax to encapsulate related functionalities within the BookManager class, promoting reusability and maintaining a clear structure.

Type Annotations: Explicitly defining types for variables, parameters, and return values throughout the codebase to ensure strict typing and prevent potential errors.

To debug TypeScript code effectively, several strategies can be employed:

Use TypeScript Compiler (tsc): Compile the TypeScript code with debugging information enabled (tsc --sourceMap) to generate source maps. These maps link the generated JavaScript code to the original TypeScript code, aiding in debugging.

IDE Debugging Tools: Leverage the debugging capabilities of IDEs like Visual Studio Code, which allows setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping through code while running in debug mode.

Console Logging: Strategically place console.log statements in critical sections of the code to log variable values, function outputs, or specific points of execution to understand the flow and values during runtime.
