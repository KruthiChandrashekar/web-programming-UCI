Testing:
When testing a React web page, I'd employ a multi-layered approach. First, I'd conduct unit tests using Jest and Enzyme to validate individual 
components, ensuring they render correctly, handle state changes, and respond as expected to user interactions. Next, integration tests using 
tools like React Testing Library would examine how these components work together, checking for proper data flow and interactions between them. 
Additionally, I'd perform end-to-end tests with tools like Cypress to simulate user behavior across the entire application, verifying 
functionalities like form submissions, navigation, and API interactions. Lastly, I'd consider accessibility testing to ensure the site is usable 
by all, adhering to WCAG standards. These combined tests would offer comprehensive coverage, increasing the likelihood of a smooth experience 
for the majority of users.
