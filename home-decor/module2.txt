4. Testing:
Testing the code to ensure it works well for the majority of users visiting the web page involves various aspects, including functionality and compatibility. Here's a breakdown of how I'd approach testing:
1. Functionality Testing:
Request Handling: Verify that the server correctly serves the index.html file and responds with the content when accessing http://localhost:3000.
Error Handling: Test scenarios where the file doesn't exist or the path is incorrect to ensure the server properly handles these cases with a 404 response. Response Headers: Check if the server sets the appropriate Content-Type header for HTML (text/html).
2. Compatibility Testing:
Cross-browser Testing: Access the web page using different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure compatibility and consistent rendering. Mobile Responsiveness: Test the page on various devices (phones, tablets) to ensure it displays properly and is responsive.
